# Liquidation

Liquidation ensures that Notional has enough capital to pay lenders and liquidity providers when they want to withdraw from the system. Because Notional allows for many types of collateral (asset cash, fCash, liquidity tokens, nTokens) there are many routes to liquidating an account in Notional.

## Terminology

- Local currency: this is the currency that the liquidator must provide to the account. If an account has borrowed DAI and collateralized with ETH, the DAI is the local currency.
- Collateral currency: the currency that collateral is held in. This is unset for local currency only liquidations.
- Local available: `netPortfolioValue + netCashBalance + netNTokenValue` from the free collateral calculation before the conversion to ETH.
- Collateral available: Same as local available but in the collateral currency.
- Local benefit required: the amount of local currency required to bring an account back to positive free collateral
- Collateral benefit: the amount of collateral currency required to bring an account back to positive free collateral

## Invariants

A liquidated account cannot assume debt as a result of liquidation. In practical terms this means that:

- If local available is positive, it cannot go below zero.
- If collateral available is positive, it cannot go below zero.
- If local available is negative, it cannot become more negative.
- Free collateral after the liquidation must be greater than free collateral before the liquidation.

## Liquidation Scenarios

Below are the possible assets may have:

| Cash Balance | nToken Balance | Liquidity Token | fCash    |
| ------------ | -------------- | --------------- | -------- |
| <>= 0        | >= 0           | >= 0            | <>= 0    |


If cash balance < 0, settle cash debt can occur regardless of the free collateral position.

When free collateral < 0, it must be that there is a negative cash or fCash balance somewhere in the portfolio. Liquidation looks for a source of positive collateral and will trade that collateral to a liquidator in exchange for cash, thereby removing the haircut on any collateral asset and splitting this benefit with the liquidated account in the form of additional free collateral and the liquidator who will receive an incentive for their action.

| Source of Debt     | Source of Collateral        | Liquidation Type       | Local Available | Collateral Available |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Local Cash / fCash | Collateral Cash             | Collateral Currency    | < 0             | > 0                  |
| Local Cash / fCash | Collateral nToken           | Collateral Currency    | < 0             | > 0                  |
| Local Cash / fCash | Collateral Liquidity Token  | Collateral Currency    | < 0             | > 0                  |
| Local Cash / fCash | Collateral fCash            | Cross Currency fCash   | < 0             | > 0                  |
| Local fCash        | Local Cash                  | Local (negative) fCash | < 0             | N/A                  |
| Local Cash / fCash | Local nToken                | Local Currency         | < 0             | N/A                  |

| Local Cash / fCash | Local fCash                 | Local fCash            | < 0             | N/A                  |
| Other Cash / fCash | Local Cash                  | Local (negative) fCash | > 0             | N/A                  |
| Other Cash / fCash | Local nToken                | Local Currency         | > 0             | N/A                  |
| Other Cash / fCash | Local Liquidity Token       | Local Currency         | > 0             | N/A                  |
| Other Cash / fCash | Local fCash                 | Local fCash            | > 0             | N/A                  |

## Local Currency

Local currency liquidation occurs when **local available** is negative and the account holds liquidity tokens or local currency nTokens. Because both those assets have haircuts applied, the account's collateral position can increase by the haircut amount minus any incentive paid to the liquidator.

To be eligible for this liquidation an account may have:

- Provided liquidity directly to a market and have a net negative fCash position that outweighs the collateral value of the account's liquidity tokens. This can occur by either borrowing against liquidity token collateral in the local currency or by providing liquidity while a market has high interest rates. In each case, the account would get into a negative local available position through market moves that decrease the value of its liquidity token collateral relative to its negative fCash.
- Holds nTokens in local currency and is a net borrower in local currency.

### Withdraw Liquidity Tokens

Withdrawing liquidity tokens from the market will convert the shifting liquidity token value into a fixed cash and fCash value. This will reduce the volatility of the account's free collateral. It will also add collateral back to the account by removing the liquidity token haircut on the cash and fCash claims.

This action does not require the liquidator to provide any local currency. The liquidator is instead paid an incentive for taking this action from the cash claim withdrawn.

### Local Currency nTokens

A liquidator may purchase nTokens for local currency at a discount. nTokens have a risk adjusted value of `nTokenPresentValue * haircut` and a liquidator may purchase nTokens at a liquidation value of `nTokenPresentValue * liquidationHaircut`. When setting the parameters, `liquidationHaircut > haircut` to ensure that some positive collateral value will flow back to the liquidated account.

The additional collateral back to the account will be: `nTokenPresentValue * (liquidationHaircut - haircut)`

## Collateral Currency

Collateral currency liquidation is likely the most common liquidation. In this situation, debts are in local currency and collateral is in a different currency. The value of the collateral has fallen relative to the local currency and it may be purchased at a discount for local currency. For this liquidation to occur the conditions must be met:

- Account has net negative local available
- Account has net positive collateral available

Collateral to purchase can take three forms: asset cash balance, collateral currency liquidity tokens, nToken balances.

### Collateral Benefit

The additional free collateral to the liquidated account is a balance between the reduction in local currency debt and the decrease in collateral available. Mathematically speaking, this benefit is:

```
collateralDenominatedBenefit = reductionInDebt - decreaseInCollateral
reductionInDebt = localPurchased * localCurrencyBuffer * exchangeRate
decreaseInCollateral = collateralSold * collateralHaircut

collateralDenominatedBenefit = localPurchased * localCurrencyBuffer * exchangeRate - collateralSold * collateralHaircut
```

Given a required collateral denominated benefit, we can solve for the amount of collateral to sell because collateral to sell and local to purchase are related.

`localPurchased = collateralToSell / (exchangeRate * liquidationDiscount)`

`collateralDenominatedBenefitRequired = collateralToSell / (exchangeRate * liquidationDiscount) * localCurrencyBuffer * exchangeRate - collateralToSell * collateralHaircut`

`collateralDenominatedBenefitRequired = collateralToSell / liquidationDiscount * localCurrencyBuffer - collateralToSell * collateralHaircut`

`collateralDenominatedBenefitRequired = collateralToSell * ((localCurrencyBuffer / liquidationDiscount) - collateralHaircut)`

`collateralToSell = collateralDenominatedBenefitRequired / ((localCurrencyBuffer / liquidationDiscount) - collateralHaircut)`

### Withdrawing Liquidity

Withdrawing liquidity tokens makes any resulting collateral cash claims available to the liquidator. No additional incentive is paid to the liquidator.

### Collateral Currency nTokens

Similar to local currency nTokens, the liquidator purchases collateral nTokens at a `liquidationHaircut`. The amount of nTokens to liquidate is calculated given:

The value of nTokens is defined as: `nTokenHaircutValue = nTokenPV * haircut`

The liquidation price of nTokens is defined as: `nTokenLiquidationValue = nTokenPV * liquidationHaircut`

The number of tokens to liquidate given is: `tokensToLiquidate = collateralToRaise * tokenBalance / (nTokenPV * liquidationHaircut)`

### Limits to Collateral Purchased

If the liquidator purchases so much collateral that local available becomes positive, it's no longer certain that the free collateral position of the account will continue to increase. This is due to potential differences in the haircuts given to the local currency and collateral currency - if the local currency has a larger haircut than the collateral currency, decreasing collateral available to increase local available above 0 will actually have a _negative_ effect on free collateral. To ensure this doesn't happen, the collateral purchased is limited to the point that local available is brought up to 0, but not higher.

## fCash Liquidation

Positive fCash is collateral for accounts in Notional and therefore can be liquidated. In these liquidations, the liquidator takes possession of fCash assets in return for providing local currency to an account.

## fCash Local Currency

Liquidating fCash in local currency can occur in the following scenarios:

- The account has positive local available but has negative free collateral in aggregate. In this case, fCash assets are purchased in exchange for cash which has higher collateral value than fCash (cash has no discount applied to it).
- The account has negative local available because it has borrowed and lent at different maturities in the local currency, and the value of its debt in the local currency outweighs the value of the fCash collateral in that currency.
- The account has borrowed and has a local currency cash balance that is no longer sufficient to collateralized the debt. This can happen because oracle rate of the debt has decreased and therefore the account must hold more collateral against the debt balance.

The benefit to the account is based on the difference between the `liquidationDiscountFactor` and the `riskAdjustedDiscountFactor`. For example, if the risk adjusted fCash haircut is 300 basis points (3%) then the liquidation discount haircut may be 150 basis points (1.5%). The liquidator will purchase fCash at 150 basis points below market value and the account will receive local currency cash. The benefit to their free collateral is equal to `benefit = fCashSold * abs(liquidationDiscountFactor - riskAdjustedDiscountFactor)`

## fCash Cross Currency

Cross currency fCash liquidation is similar to local currency fCash liquidation except that the liquidator provides local currency but purchases fCash denominated in a collateral currency. This situation can arise when an account borrows in local currency but is lending the collateral currency.

Similar to collateral currency liquidation, the account must have negative local available and positive collateral available. The calculations are a combination of determining the collateral to sell as well as the benefit gained by converting fCash to cash (`totalBenefit = fCashBenefit + collateralBenefit`).

```
fCashBenefit = fCashSold * (liquidationDiscountFactor - riskAdjustedDiscountFactor)
collateralBenefit = collateralSold * ((localBuffer / liquidationDiscount) - collateralHaircut)
```

During this liquidation it must be ensured that the account's free collateral position does not decrease. This is ensured by checking that:

- Local available does not go above zero.
- Collateral available does not go below zero.

The change to local available is:

`deltaLocalAvailable = (fCashSold * liquidationDiscountFactor) / (exchangeRate * liquidationDiscount)`

The change to collateral available is:

`deltaCollateralAvailable = -(fCashSold * riskAdjustedPV)`

## Liquidator Parameters

During times of price volatility and high gas prices, it is safer and more gas efficient to liquidate an account to a free collateral position that is much more than zero. The liquidated account will be more resilient to continued price volatility. This will also increase liquidation profitability for liquidators. To allow for this, Notional has a `DEFAULT_LIQUIDATION_PORTION` that allows liquidators to purchase additional collateral above the minimum required to recollateralize an account.

Liquidators may want also want to limit the amount of collateral, nTokens or fCash they purchase. Where relevant, the liquidator can specify the maximum amount of assets they want to purchase.
